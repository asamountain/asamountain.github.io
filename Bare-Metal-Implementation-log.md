# BareMetal Practice

this seems very important because handling bare meta does super matter without caring only the library.
it can shorten the speed of access into each chips registry, so can work faster and lesser cost.
but I wonder what kinds of cost actually it requires for activating it when a chip worked or c++ codes helped it out.
probably an electricsity. Isn't it?

## Uno is better than PI

yes. anyway, I figured out it is better to practice with UNO, not Rasberry Pi. because Rasberry pi has its own Operating System so already built up with many packages
but I wonder why this OS preinstalled environment isn't good for bare metal practice? because those libraries will work easily without direct access each chips and operation?
probably yes. anyway 

## Gemini Cli is the teacher for me

so I figured it out with Gemini 3 pro. It mentored me like an Embedded Professor. and my goal is fetching data from my humidity sensor and LCD pannel.


the fisrt step was turning on my UNO. yes powering an UNO with my electricity.

## What are those all the terms?
